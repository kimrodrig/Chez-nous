          <em>chez nous</em> is a restaurant run out of a residential apartment. We—the two of us, Kevin and Kim—believe a lot of restaurant overhead is unnecessary and obstructive to gastronomy. Commercial real estate, excessive and outdated equipment, passionless drones on the line, delivery costs, the archaic ‘gratuity’ system, abundant waste: you are actually paying the hidden price for all of this when you eat out.

          Our dinner is different. We’ve married our Michelin experience and technique with state-of-the-art culinary tech that has only become available in the last few years. The hours Kevin spends in the kitchen experimenting like a mad chemist regularly produces more ideas than we can fit on our two menus. And since we exercise total creative liberty in crafting our menu, we end up with a beautiful and unique degustation for each dinner.

        <p className="about-p">
          Right now, we're in Long Island City. We set up a handful of tables in a living room, and when you reserve one, you are booking a full four-plus course menu (including unscripted surprises) with a wine and cocktail pairing. We’re cooking and expediting from the kitchen.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p className="about-p">  
          The dinner plus pairing costs $125. The way that we’re running the service requires parties to arrive on time, because cooking is all about timing, and tardiness throws off the way courses get plated, especially in a small kitchen. So that’s our only request: come open-minded, hungry, and on time. And bring cash. There’s a $25 deposit that needs to be paid in advance, and once you arrive, you’ll pay $100. Instructions regarding the deposit will be provided upon making a reservation. The exact location will also be disclosed at that point.

          We have a vegan menu and will try to accommodate your dietary restrictions, but please tell us in advance! You can do so when you book a reservation.

          To make a reservation, sign up, and you'll be ushered to the reservations page. Or you can go to the reservations page directly, and enter your details when you book a table. We look forward to seeing you soon!
